# 1982: 8-bit Life
This is a platformer game created in the tradition of 1980's style platformers.
It is created in Python 3 and Pygame.

## Bare with me...
**PLEASE NOTE** at this stage in time the game is in **Pre-Alpha**. So, do
not expect much quality or any "fun" at this early stage of development.

I am presently in the process of learning how to create games written in
Python. I probably shouldn't have this repository public at this stage.
But, it __could__ prove interesting to others out there. Especilly as the
game evolves over time.

My primary resource for learning Python is the book
"Python Crash Course" 2nd Ed. By Eric Matthes.

I welcome __constructive__ commentary and criticism as well as any ideas you may have.
